# Middle Earth Travel Agent
This is a made for fun travel agent that allows the user to explore lore of different locations across Middle Earth as well as book a trip to them. On the start up page, pick a location in the center drop down box and choose "Explore It!" or "Book It!". Exploring the location takes you to a page that shows off different details on the location. Booking the location allows you to select a date to start the journey and a date to end the journey, as well as allowing you to bring companions and/or mounts. Clicking "Go On An Adventure!" takes you to the booking success page. Doing so displays your trip details.
